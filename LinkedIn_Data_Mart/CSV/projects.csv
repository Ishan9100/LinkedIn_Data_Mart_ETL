Centered on investigating the feasibility of reducing the number of questions in a psychological test without compromising the validity of the results.

The conclusions of this projects aim to answer the following reflection: it is preferable to maintain the number of original questions with ideally more valid results or to reduce the number of questions so that the user is more likely to take the test and maintain attention during the test despite theoretically not having full accuracy.

To answer this, deep learning and machine learning techniques are employed. The methodology includes researching the theory and basis of the most commonly used psychological tests, training different models with data open source data from a psychological test, using different feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant questions, and then training optimized models with a reduced number of features to compare the outcomes.

This paper describes the architecture, methodology, and results of our THAURUS chatbot developed for the Alexa Prize Socialbot Grand Challenge (SGC5). Our proposal relies on several innovative ideas to take advantage of existing LLMs to create engaging user experiences that are capable of handling real users in a scalable way and without compromising the competition rules. Different SotA dialogue generators were fine-tuned and incorporated to give variability and handling the wide range of topic conversations; we also developed mechanisms to control the quality of the responses (e.g., detecting and handling toxic interactions, keeping topic coherence, and increasing engagement by providing up-to-date information in a conversational style).

In addition, our system extends the capabilities of the Cobot architecture by in- corporating modules to automatically generate images, provide voice cloning capabilities with fictional characters, serve contextual sounds for detected entities in the dialogue, better capitalization and punctuation capabilities, and to provide natural expressions of interest.

Finally, we also included a trained generative selector and a reference-free model for automatic evaluation of turns that could reduce latencies and complement the ranker’s capabilities to select the best generative answer.",
