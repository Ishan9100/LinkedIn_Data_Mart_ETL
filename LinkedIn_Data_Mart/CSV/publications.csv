"ajjames","What Makes A Loyal Customer?","Innovation Enterprise | Chief Strategy Officer","1","3","2016","The notion of the ‘loyal customer’ has been described as a ‘threatened species’. Commitment to a brand is considered anachronistic, and programs to support loyalty are regarded by some critics as doomed ventures. But I would argue that customer loyalty has been getting a bad rap. And part of the reason for this is that marketers have approached customer loyalty the wrong way, and have focused on locking customers in, rather than attracting new markets.","https://channels.theinnovationenterprise.com/articles/what-makes-a-loyal-customer"
